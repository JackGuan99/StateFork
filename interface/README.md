# StateFork Interfaces

## ⚙️ Interactive CLI Interface

### 1. Launch the Interactive Shell
```bash
(sudo) python3 -m interface.shell --method {method}
```
Currently supported methods:
- `docker` (default) - for Docker-based environments focused on filesystem snapshots
- `podman` - for Podman-based environments focused on filesystem snapshots
- `criu` - for CRIU-based environments focused on process state snapshots
- `hybrid` - for Podman+CRIU environments combining filesystem and process state snapshots
- `ckpt` - for our own [Checkpoint-lite](https://github.com/Alex-XJK/checkpoint-lite/) environments

### 2. Inside the Interactive Shell
After launching the shell with the desired method, you will see a prompt similar to this:
```
StateFork Container Manager - Interactive Shell
Commands: snapshot, restore <id>, step, tree, stats, history, storage, exit

StateFork > _
```
See the sample run screenshot below.

### 3. Common Commands

## 🚀 RPC Interface

To be implemented in the future, allowing remote management of snapshots and state.
